    I used the technique I learned from part2b, then used a new texture and changed the velocity to make a "sakura falling" scene.

    1st row(left to right):
       cube4: followed lab4 instructions.
       cube5: followed lab4 instructions. Used texture 176 and tiled it into a 2x2 grid.
    2ed row(left to right):
       cube1 & 2: followed lab4 instructions.
       cube3: used the same method as cube2, except I mismatched the texture(160) and normal map(173_norm) using three.js's built-in functionality.

    Answers:
       a. x = u * 8
       b. y = v * -8 + 8
       c. white

    The first cube was made using wireframe shader to show the cube's frame with the color of my preference.
    The second cube is exactly the same as the one shown in the lab header, made by mixing RGB colors.
    The other two cubes were made step by step using the lab handout.
